# Analyzing Gun Violence Trends in the United States

## Overview
This project explores the patterns and factors influencing gun violence incidents across the United States. Through in-depth data visualization and analysis, it aims to uncover insights that can inform policy decisions and prevention efforts.

## Research Questions
The key research questions guiding this project are:

1. What are the general trends in gun-related incidents across time and geography?
2. Which states or cities report the highest number of incidents or casualties?
3. What correlations exist between the number of guns involved and incident severity?
4. Are there demographic patterns that suggest certain groups are more affected by gun violence?

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes over 26,000 gun-related incidents recorded across the United States from 2013 to 2017. The main fields captured include:

- Date
- Location (state and city)
- Incident details (number of victims and suspects)
- Demographics (age, gender)
- Gun types

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Tableau for data visualization and exploration. Key steps included:

1. Examining the overall trends in gun violence incidents over time
2. Identifying geographic hotspots with the highest number of incidents
3. Investigating the relationship between the number of guns involved and incident severity
4. Analyzing demographic factors and their influence on gun violence patterns

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed several significant insights:

- Gun violence incidents increased exponentially from 2015 to 2018, with a sharp rise in the number of suspects and victims involved.
- Certain states and cities, such as Illinois, California, Texas, and Florida, reported the highest total number of incidents, likely due to population factors.
- Incidents with a higher average number of guns tended to result in more casualties, underscoring the need to address firearm accessibility.
- Handguns were the most common weapon used by suspects, and males, especially pre-teens and teenagers, were disproportionately affected as both perpetrators and victims.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
The comprehensive analysis presented in this project provides crucial data-driven insights into the complex issue of gun violence in the United States. By synthesizing these findings, stakeholders can develop more targeted and effective approaches to mitigate this critical problem.

Moving forward, potential next steps for this project include:

1. Incorporating more up-to-date data to analyze the latest trends.
2. Conducting a deeper dive into the demographic factors influencing gun violence.
3. Investigating the impacts of different gun control policies and interventions.
4. Exploring the role of mental health, substance abuse, and other societal factors.
5. Engaging with local communities to address their specific needs and concerns.

By continuing to build on this foundation of research and data-driven insights, this project aims to contribute to a more informed and effective approach to addressing the challenge of gun violence in America.
